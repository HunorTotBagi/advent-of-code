# What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual online programming competition and puzzle-solving event that takes place in December. It was created by Eric Wastl and first held in 2015. The event consists of a series of daily programming puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas. Participants solve these puzzles using their programming skills and submit their solutions online.
