# What is Advent of Code? ðŸŽ„

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual online programming competition and puzzle-solving event that takes place in December. It was created by Eric Wastl and first held in 2015. The event consists of a series of daily programming puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas. Participants solve these puzzles using their programming skills and submit their solutions online.

In this repository, you can find my C# solution. The main implementation is located in the `Src` folder, while various test cases are organized within the `Test` project.
